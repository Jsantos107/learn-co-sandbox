#(You provide a name (english_music_by_city), an assignment operator (=) and then a list of pairs, separated by commas, that should go in the Hash, wrapped in {}. Each pair should have a name (typically a Symbol), a "rocket" symbol (=>), and a value. A value is often a scalar value, but it could be another collection, more on that later.)
