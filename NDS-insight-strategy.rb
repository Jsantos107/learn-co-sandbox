See-saw between bottom-up and top-down method writing

Write a method that provides an insight e.g. oldest_student

Evaluate your First Order Methods

YES: Great! Your method is done!

NO: Build a new method that combines other methods to get closer to what the insight method needs. Repeat step 4

Insight method provides an insight! We're done!
